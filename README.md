# MyLib42

**Project Name:** MyLib42
**Description:**
MyLib42 is a custom library developed during my studies at 42. This library contains essential functions that I implemented from scratch, aiming to be reusable in various projects. Designed for robustness and efficiency, MyLib42 aligns with the **Norminette** standards, ensuring seamless integration with the requirements of 42 and practical use in real-world development.

## Objectives
- **Learning:** Master the fundamental concepts of C by building my own library.
- **Reusability:** Provide a reliable set of tools for future projects at 42 and beyond.
- **Long-term Utility:** Use MyLib42 as a foundation for personal and professional growth as a developer.

- `ft_itoa` - Convert an integer to a string.
- `ft_litoa` - Convert a long integer to a string.

### 5. Memory Functions
- `ft_memset` - Fill memory with a constant byte.
- `ft_bzero` - Zero out a memory area.
- `ft_memcpy` - Copy a memory area.
- `ft_memmove` - Move memory safely between overlapping areas.
- `ft_memchr` - Locate a byte in memory.
- `ft_memcmp` - Compare two memory areas.
- `ft_calloc` - Allocate and initialize memory.

- `ft_putstr_fd` - Write a string to a file descriptor.
- `ft_putendl_fd` - Write a string followed by a newline to a file descriptor.
- `ft_putnbr_fd` - Write a number to a file descriptor.

### 7. Printf Functionality
- `ft_printf` - Format and print data to standard output.
- Support for:
  - Characters (`%c`)
  - Strings (`%s`)
  - Pointers (`%p`)
  - Integers (`%d`/`%i`)
  - Unsigned integers (`%u`)
  - Hexadecimals (`%x`/`%X`)

- Custom width, precision, and flag support (`-`, `+`, `#`, `0`, and space).
- Helper functions for string formatting and hexadecimal conversion.

### 8. Advanced Functionality
- Support for formatted strings and complex input/output operations.

## Benefits for 42 Projects
- Speeds up development with pre-tested, reusable components.
- Reduces errors by relying on robust, proven functions.
- Provides flexibility and compatibility with 42's Norminette standards.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C
- **Tools:** Makefile, Norminette for code style compliance, and unit tests for validation.

## Deliverables
- Organized `.c` and `.h` files in a clear directory structure.
- Comprehensive documentation for each function.
- Unit tests to ensure reliability and robustness.

## Ambition
MyLib42 is more than just a project‚Äîit's a growing toolkit that will evolve with my skills and become an essential resource in my journey as a developer. üöÄ
